# Multi-Modal-Physical-Exercise-Classification
### In this project, real multi-modal data is studied by utilizing different techniques presented during the course Multi-modal Data Fusion. Open MEx dataset from UCI machine learning repository is used. Idea is to apply different techniques to recognize physical exercises from wearable sensors and depth camera, user-independently.
